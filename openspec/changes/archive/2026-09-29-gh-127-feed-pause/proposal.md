## Why

[Issue #127](https://github.com/jimmie-potts/divoom-app-upgrade/issues/127) supplies the consumer pause boundary needed by [Hub aggregate reset](https://github.com/jimmie-potts/agent-device-hub/issues/557). A live paired consumer must stop reading the old owner before its revision resets, while its local pages and controller keep answering.

## What Changes

- Add a private paired-run pause request and a process-bound acknowledgment after active Hub requests drain.
- Keep local reads responsive and report retained feed freshness truthfully while paused.
- Release the pause during an explicitly authorized paired reseed, after the old process stops and before the fresh process starts.
- Extend verification negative controls and operating guidance; preserve ordinary launches, ports, tokens and frozen proof.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

None.

### Modified Capabilities

- `simulator-verification`: add live paired-feed pause, drained acknowledgment and authorized reseed behavior.

## Impact

Changes affect the remote monitor request seam, guarded verification launch, scenario seeding and paired checks. The shared core and receipt version remain unchanged. Installed services, device behavior and public APIs are outside this source-only change. Hub owns aggregate orchestration and final composition qualification after consuming the accepted revision.
