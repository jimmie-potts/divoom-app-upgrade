## Context

See proposal.md for the consumer boundary required by Hub #557. The shared core already reseeds in stop → seed → launch → readiness order and clears data/home/tmp while preserving runtime-root token files. Holding pause through readiness would prevent the fresh consumer from accepting the reset owner.

## Goals / Non-Goals

Keep the live consumer responsive while the owner resets, with a verifiable drain boundary and a safe handoff to fresh consumer state. This is a disposable verification control; installed configuration, shared core versions and public APIs are unchanged. A general coordination service or cross-process lock for arbitrary independent per-run commands is outside scope.

## Decisions

The remote session source funnels timer refreshes, browser refreshes and forwarded commands through one request function. Inject a gate only from the explicit verification transport preload, count requests synchronously at admission and retain the count through response-body consumption. The paired seed does not configure the optional playback reader.

Use the existing private runtime directory. `feed-pause.request` and `feed-pause.release` contain strict JSON `{version:1,runId,nonce}`, with a 32-character lowercase hexadecimal nonce. `feed-pause.ack` adds the live process's positive integer `pid`. Reads are bounded to 4 KiB, regular, owned, private files without symlinks. Acknowledgments use mode 0600 and atomic replacement; no credential appears in controls or errors.

A pause stays active through the owner reset. Hub validates its nonce and the receipt's systemd process identity, then writes release authorization only after its owner reseed succeeds. Consumer seed checks authorization before writing and consumes it after successful seed, before fresh launch. Consumption atomically claims the controls into a private directory, validates the claimed contents, and deletes only those claimed files. A changed claim is restored without overwriting a newer public control; failed-run cleanup removes retained claims. An unconditional seed-time unlink could resume an old consumer during owner reset; leaving pause through readiness would prevent recovery. Neither alternative satisfies the contract.

Diagnostics skip with an explicit pause reason and do not probe Hub while paused; invalid controls fail. Hub must require ordinary passed checks after release. The acknowledgment covers this serving process's requests. The coordinator serializes aggregate mutations and avoids concurrent per-run doctor/capture/scenario operations while resetting.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- A paused feed might appear current → retain the prior snapshot but preserve existing age/freshness semantics and mark observation stale where required.
- A request changes during acknowledgment or seed → recheck run and nonce before publishing or consuming controls; never remove a newer request using old authorization.
- Reset fails halfway → report the named error and never resume polling. Seed itself does not consume refused authorization; the core may remove runtime controls when cleaning up an already stopped failed run. Frozen proof remains separate. No automatic rollback or command retry is introduced.
- Private runtime files are removed or made invalid → stop admission and withhold successful acknowledgment instead of silently ignoring the request.

## Migration Plan

Land this opt-in source change with independent review and CI. Hub #557 updates its composition pin only after this delivery passes its own gates. No installation or live-state migration occurs. A failed disposable run can be stopped and started again with the existing commands; frozen local proof remains separate.
